-- The functions in this module are exactly the same as
-- 'Control.DeepSeq', but without the need for an 'NFData' instance.
--
-- The semantics are not terribly well defined, since they are based on
-- what 'unpackClosure#' returns in its pointer list, but it appears
-- that we NEVER recurse into AP or PAP objects.

import GHC.Exts

-- NOTE: This is a bit slower than a normal NFData instance
-- because unpackClosure# has to allocate arrays to report
-- the results.  I tried writing a hand-rolled loop but it
-- was tricky. If this is a bottleneck I'll try again.
--
-- NOTE: Thankfully, unpackClosure# doesn't look through
-- thunks/function closures, so this behavior is actually
-- somewhat reasonable.
